This project has two Power BI dashboards to help you understand student data.

##   📌 Overview

##   📂 Data Source

The data for these dashboards comes from a "click consulting" database with student information.

**Here's the information we use:**

* `FullName`: Student's full name
* `CalcGrade`: Student's grade (A, B, C)
* `Enrollment Date`: When the student enrolled
* `Country`: Student's country
* `Department`: Student's department (Arts, Commerce, etc.)
* `Payment Method`: How the student paid
* `Created Date`: When the student's record was made
* `Student ID`: Student's unique ID

##   📊 Setup

1.  **Get the files:** Download the Power BI files (.pbix) to your computer.
2.  **Open the files:** Open them using Power BI Desktop (make sure you have it).
3.  **Connect your data:** Change the data source to use your own student data. You'll need to change the settings in Power BI Desktop.
4.  **Update the dashboards:** Refresh the data to show your information.
5.  **Change things (if you want):** You can change the charts and filters.
